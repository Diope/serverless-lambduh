# Serverless-Lambduh

Been learning Terraform and CloudFormation IaC for the past couple months, and someone suggested I check out [serverless.js](https://serverless.com) (how they were able to get that domain name I'll never know!) and so this is just some simple Serverless usage to deploy to AWS Lambda also using Github Actions.

The lambda function will be super basic, I'm just generating a random number. Again this is just for learning Serverless.js.
